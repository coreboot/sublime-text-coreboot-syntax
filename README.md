easier.

## Currently supported syntaxes:

### Coreboot Device Tree

Device Tree aliases are also supported. This allows jumping between references and
definitions of device tree devices.

Coming Soon:
* C - There is [PR](https://github.com/sublimehq/Packages/pull/1831) that
	  drastically improves the C syntax definition.
* Kconfig
* ASL
